# SDET Project

## Project Description

I will be creating a Space Invader game that will allow the user to keep track of high scores and compare them against one another. The user will be able to login with a Username and Password allowing the high scores they set to be tracked under their name. 



## Project Goals

* The project has to be a 3 Tier Application
  * It should include a Model, Business and GUI Layer
* The project should also include Tests where there are multiple test cases to ensure the application works as intended
* The project should include an SQL database with at least two linked tables. These tables will be:
  * The "User" Table to keep track of Username and Password as well as any other data that is related to the user. This table will have a 1 to Many relationship with the Leaderboard table.
  * The "Leaderboard" Table to link the Users to their scores.
* The project should use Entity Framework to manage the relationship between the backend object model and the database
* The project should be easily tracked through git commits and have a thorough ReadMe File.
* The project should also fit the project Description
